## Setup Day - Getting Hal Running

### Accomplished
- ✅ Switched default model from Opus 4.5 to Sonnet 4.5 (cost savings)
- ✅ Enabled LAN access (gateway bind=lan)
- ✅ Set up iMessage channel
  - Installed imsg via Homebrew
  - Granted Full Disk Access to Terminal
  - Paired dave@dellaquila.com
  - Had to run from Terminal (not LaunchAgent) for permissions
- ✅ Set up Telegram channel
  - Created bot via @BotFather
  - Bot token: 8568319936:AAGQuQj... (in config)
  - Paired Telegram ID: 8395810644
  - Preferred chat method (better formatting than iMessage)

### Technical Notes
- Command Line Tools needed updating for macOS 26
- imsg needs Full Disk Access + Automation permissions
- LaunchAgent vs Terminal permissions issue (resolved by running gateway from Terminal)

### Learned About Dave
- Family: Wife Nancy, sons Quentin (30, b. May 30) & Sawyer (27, b. June 22?)
- Location sharing setup via Find My (whole family)
- Interests: Pool (learning, plays with neighbors), driving events
- Planning: May & October driving events (details TBD)
- Uses Airtable for data management (no integration yet)

### Tools & Monitoring
- Added monitoring section to TOOLS.md
- `clawdbot logs --follow` for live debugging
- Reasoning mode available with `/reasoning on`

### Next Steps
- Confirm Sawyer's birthday (June 22?)
- Explore Airtable integration for driving events
- Consider building custom Airtable skill
- Maybe create driving event poster designs (via external tools - no built-in image gen)

### Questions/Topics for Later
- Find My integration (decided against due to privacy/complexity)
- Image generation for event posters (need external tools)
- Short video creation (no built-in capability)
