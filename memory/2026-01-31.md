## Morning
- Dave said good morning at 7:33 AM
- **Issue:** Pairing messages appearing in existing iMessage chats
- **Fixed:** Disabled iMessage channel (kept Telegram as primary)
  - Set `channels.imessage.enabled = false`
  - Set `plugins.entries.imessage.enabled = false`
  - Gateway restarted to apply changes

## Token Usage Concerns
- Dave wants to reduce token costs (high usage)
- **New preference: Shorter, concise responses**
- Skip verbose explanations unless asked
- Use links/references when possible

## Late Morning / Afternoon
- **11:00 AM** - Breakfast at Plate 88 (Highway 88) with Rachel and Robyn
  - Eggs Benedict + 2 Bloody Marys (8/10, server: Ariel)
- **12:47 PM** - Drove up Highway 88 to Kirkwood Lodge with Rachel and Robyn
